Front-end React Project

Code here makes up the frontend part of the project I reference in my personal statement. This program will simply display a user interface, to view the back-end part of this project please refer to my other repository.

After directing yourself to the project's location in your console, launch it by typing "npm start". (You will need to have installed npm previously however)

Yet to be completed, this frontend project is running on top of Facebook's React framework. 

This project was designed to work alongside the API built in the other repository. 

Currently working on implementing redux and improving my CSS skills
